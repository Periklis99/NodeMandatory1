<h1>Nodemon!!</h1>
<h3>What is Nodemon used for?</h3>
<h3>Nodemon is a command-line interface (CLI) utility that wraps your Node app, watches the file system
     and automatically restarts the process so you dont have to do it manually every time you change something in your code and its perfect for development.</h3>
     <h3>To install it globally, run "npm install -g nodemon". And Nodemon will be installed on your system path, and you will be able to use the "nodemon" command directly on the command line.</h3>
     <h3>
        Then use the terminal to navigate to the folder you want wrap with nodemon and execute the command nodemon app.js (app.js is the main file of your code ,usually we find it as "index.js". In that case you type "nodemon index.js") and you are good to go :)
     </h3>
     <h3>If you want nodemon to monitor your js,css and html files as well you can add to the package.json file the following: 
        "nodemonConfig": { 
      "ext": "js,json,css,html" 
    },
