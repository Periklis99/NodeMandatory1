<p>What is Node JS ?</h3>
<p>Node is an (environment) open source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side. 
    Node is useful for developing applications that require a persistent connection from the browser to the server and is often used for real-time applications such as chat, news feeds and web push notifications.
    It's a light, scalable, and cross-platform way to execute code.Nodejs is actually not a framework or a library, but a runtime environment, based on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and can be used both on the frontend and the backend.</p>
