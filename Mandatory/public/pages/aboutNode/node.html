<h1>Node!!</h1>
<h3>What is Node JS ?</h3>
<h3>Node is an (environment) open source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side. 
    Node is useful for developing applications that require a persistent connection from the browser to the server and is often used for real-time applications such as chat, news feeds and web push notifications.
    It's a light, scalable, and cross-platform way to execute code.Nodejs is actually not a framework or a library, but a runtime environment, based on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and can be used both on the frontend and the backend.</h3>
    <h3>To download and install node you need to visit https://nodejs.org/ and follow the steps.</h3>
    <h3>You can run a node.js application by typing in the terminal "node app.js"</h3>
